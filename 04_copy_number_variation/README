## Analysisng CNVs (Figure S3)
## - filtering for poor quality coverage
## - subsampling unrelated strains within groups
## - calculating frequencies of CNVs in groups & plotting heatmaps (this only after running some bash scripts)

### Complete file with coverage estimates can be downloaded from figshare as File S6.
